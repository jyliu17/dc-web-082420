# A puppy is initialized with a cuteness score of 5.  A puppy can raise
# its cuteness score by 3 points if it gets groomed, and lower its score
# by 5 points playing in the mud.  

# The following code works, but there are some problems.  Refactor this code 
# to improve it.  (The code can be downloaded from your learn.co page under
# lecture 04)
