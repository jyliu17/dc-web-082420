# Object Oriented Javascript

- Javascript Under the hood
- ES5
- ES6

## Object Creation Patterns

- literal
- {}
- Factory pattern
- `new` Object

## `new` and constructor calls

- properties
- methods

## Prototype Chain, and `__proto__`

- .**proto** property of an object, points to that object's parent's prototype object

## Parts of a Class

- Attributes (instance variables)
- Class variables
- Methods (call some function associated with the object)
  - Instance methods - behavior of one of these kinds of objects
  - Class methods - behavior associated with the whole class

## `class` syntax

- They are not hoisted

## Object inheritance and Object relationships
